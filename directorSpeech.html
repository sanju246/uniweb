        <p>
            As the Director at IBA, Jahangirnagar University, it gives me great pleasure and profound honor to take on the duty of advancing this institute into new frontiers of quality and success in addition to preserving and carrying on its rich heritage. As an educator and a mentor, I intend to utilize this position to not only bring significant value to the table, but also set examples for future generations to follow.
        </p>

        <p>
            IBA, Jahangirnagar University started its journey more than 30 years ago and pioneered in offering BBA in Bangladesh. Throughout the years, IBA JU has been committed to achieve excellence through grit and hard work, and pass on the importance of perseverance and determination, combined with the necessity of being ethically and morally strong to our students.
        </p>

        <p>
            We aim to see each one of our students graduating with confidence that the world is waiting for them with numerous opportunities, only waiting to be seized by them. I am proud to claim that our students have displayed these values throughout the years, in different sectors across the country, and I strongly believe that the current and next generation of students will continue this legacy of IBA. Our teaching faculty have received international acclamations in the past years in research, furthering IBAâ€™s cause in making the institute a world-class research hub for both teachers and students to benefit from.
        </p>

        <p>
            We have students contributing in every sector of the economy, starting from the government, banks, education, NGOs, multinational and international conglomerates, local companies, defense and even the media. They are taking on leadership roles, and displaying immense strength and gentleness simultaneously in their positions. While we as teachers only guided them for a few years, our students have upheld our name in the country. We aim to foster a strong relationship between academia and industry in the upcoming years, in order to ensure that our graduates are equipped with not just theoretical knowledge, but also a very good understanding of what awaits them outside the classroom.
        </p>

        <p>
            I have spent two decades here at IBA, Jahangirnagar University, learning and growing with my esteemed colleagues and beloved students, and this position has given me the wonderful opportunity of taking a step towards catapulting IBA towards its full potential.
